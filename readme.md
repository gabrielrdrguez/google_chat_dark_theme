# Google Chat Dark Theme

So far google chat webapp hasn't made a dark theme available, so I made my own.

  - This was done in a few minutes, don't expect it to be perfect
  - I don know for how long this will work, afaik they may change classes naming scheme from one day to another

## Installation

Download chrome extension [Stylebot](https://github.com/ankit/stylebot)

Paste the code from `stylebot.css` inside code tab on Stylebot.

That's it!
